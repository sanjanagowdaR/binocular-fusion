Binocular fusion using OpenCV involves combining images from two cameras to create a depth map, similar to how human vision works. This technique is often used in applications like 3D reconstruction, robotics, and augmented reality. Here's a high-level overview of how you can achieve this with OpenCV:

1. **Camera Calibration**: Calibrate both cameras to determine their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. This step ensures that the images from both cameras are aligned correctly.
2. **Stereo Rectification**: Rectify the images to align them on the same plane. This makes it easier to compare corresponding points in the images.
3. **Disparity Map Calculation**: Compute the disparity map by finding corresponding points between the two rectified images. The disparity map shows the difference in horizontal coordinates of corresponding points and is inversely proportional to depth.
4. **Depth Map Generation**: Convert the disparity map to a depth map, which provides the distance of each pixel from the camera.
5. **3D Reconstruction**: Use the depth map to reconstruct the 3D structure of the scene.
